# Configuration barcode extraction tool
Extracts configuration barcodes and surrounding text from barcode scanner manuals and
attempts to regenerate them (as close as possble to the original) in SVG and PNG for
further use.

Uses zxing-wasm, rxing-wasm and tesseract.js under the hood.
Reimplementation of a now defunct C++ version.
